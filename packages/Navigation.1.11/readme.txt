What is Navigation for ASP.NET?
-------------------------------
It is a unique take on state management in ASP.NET applications that
puts the Url back into the WUrld Wide Web.

Why do you need it?
-------------------
With it you can write web apps that
	- Implement Ajax and yet are visible to search engines.
	- Work with the browser back button and across multiple tabs.
	- Provide dynamic breadcrumbs rather than static sitemaps.
	- Are accessible to all browsers.

Who's it for?
-------------
It's for anybody who's using ASP.NET MVC or Web Forms to render HTML
on the server. If you're using javascript libraries to render HTML
on the client, then this framework probably isn't for you. 

Where do you get it?
--------------------
You get it from NuGet by running the command Install-Package Navigation
